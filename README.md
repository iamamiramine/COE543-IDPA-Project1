Data Processing Algorithms: Tree Edit Distance

Libraries needed to run this project:

  1-numpy
  
  2-xml
  
  3-lxml
  
  4-tkinter
  
Run this project using PyCharm IDE.

The gui.py script is a graphical user interface that runs the whole project

The prerpocessing.py script pre-processes an XML document into a tree doucment

The processing.py script runs the Neirman and Jagadish Tree Edit Distance algorithm to transform Tree A into Tree B

The postprocessing.py script exports the transformed Tree A into an XML document
